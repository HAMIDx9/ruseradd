rUserAdd is a program to add root user to GNU/Linux OSs 

It is recommended for newbie hackers while they become root on a server, they
can use this software to add a root user to account immediately without any
complication.

Thanks to Pr0grammer @ Ashiyane.org for his idea

This program has been created to show usage of glib native functions and programming 
for linux base software.
